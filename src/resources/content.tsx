      <>
I am a final-year Computer Engineering student and soon-to-be fresh
 graduate with a strong passion for software and DevOps engineering.
  I’m deeply committed to
 designing and developing reliable, scalable applications while 
 continuously exploring cloud technologies, AI integration, and system security.

With a solid background in cryptography, I’m particularly
 interested in secure system design and data protection. 
 I enjoy tackling complex technical challenges, learning 
 emerging technologies, and creating impactful, real-world solutions.

I am now seeking a full-time opportunity where I can 
apply my skills, contribute to innovative projects, 
and grow as a professional engineer in a dynamic and
 forward-thinking environment.
