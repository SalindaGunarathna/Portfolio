## Overview

"Find Cameramen" is a mobile application designed to simplify the process of hiring professional photographers and videographers for any event. The platform, built with **Flutter**, serves as a two-sided marketplace, allowing customers to discover skilled cameramen and cameramen to showcase their work to a wide audience.

As a **backend developer** on the team, I was responsible for designing and implementing the **Firebase** functionalities that power the app. My primary focus was on creating the data models and real-time listeners to ensure seamless communication and data flow between customers and cameramen.

## Key Features

- **Discover & Browse**: Customers can easily browse diverse portfolios from numerous cameramen to find the perfect style for their event.
- **Showcase Portfolios**: Cameramen can create profiles, upload albums of their work, and share them directly on the platform.
- **In-App Ordering**: A streamlined, hassle-free ordering system allows customers to book a cameraman directly through the app.
- **Explore & Connect**: Users can discover stunning albums and follow their favorite cameramen to stay updated on their latest work.
- **Secure Cloud Storage**: Leveraged **Firebase Storage** to ensure all images and user data are stored securely and reliably.

## Technologies Used

- **Mobile App**: Flutter
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)**: Firebase (Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storage)

## Challenges and Learnings

My main challenge was designing the backend data structure in Firebase (Firestore) to efficiently manage the complex relationships between users, cameramen, portfolios, and orders. Implementing the real-time listeners for seamless communication (like order status updates or new portfolio uploads) without creating unnecessary network traffic was a key learning experience. This project solidified my skills in serverless architecture and building data-driven mobile applications.

## Outcome

The result is a fully functional, real-time mobile platform that effectively connects clients with event photography professionals. The app simplifies the search and booking process, providing a one-stop solution for both sides of the marketplace.
